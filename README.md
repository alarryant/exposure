# Exposure

Exposure, an open platform that allows freelance photographers and potential clients to connect. Exposure allows users to search images by keyword and navigate to the photographer's profile that fits their style. Photographers can customize their profile by uploading images to their portfolio, provide pricing and update their availability on the calendar. This was a collaborative project where I took part in both front and back end development and was completed in two weeks.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
2. Run migrations: `npm run knex migrate:latest`
3. Run the seed: `npm run knex seed:run`
4. Start the web server using the `npm start` command. Start the app server using `node server.js`.
5. Go to <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser and explore Exposure!
